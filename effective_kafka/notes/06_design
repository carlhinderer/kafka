- Roles and Responsibilities

    - Event-Oriented Broadcast

        - In a broadcast arrangment, it is a best practice for the producer ecosystem to
            assume ownership of the topic.  This includes:

            - The lifecycle of the topic and the broker-side configuration
            - Retention and compaction
            - Nature and content of data, encodings, record schema, versioning strategy
            - Number of partitions and keying of records


        - The consumer just decides whether to subscribe to the topic of not


    - Peer-to-peer Messaging

        - In this case, a consumer is effectively responding to specific commands issues by
            the producer, and in most cases emitting responses back to the producer.


        - In this case, the consumer should have custodianship over the topic.


    - Topic Conditioning

        - A problem can arise, when the producer has total control of the topic, where consumers
            cannot trust that they will not be negatively affected by changes in the producer.


        - A SEDA (Staged Event-Driven Architecture) can help solve this problem.  We can have 
            intermediate topics that condition the data to conform to an individual consumer
            group's expectations.

            Producer  ->  COMMON TOPIC

                                           CONDITIONING GROUP B  ->  TOPIC FOR B  ->  Consumer
                                               (Transform)
